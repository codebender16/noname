### About

Sturdy cards is flash cards with spaced repetition learning feature. It is created for anyone who wants to reinforce their learning through spaced repetition.

The concept is simple.

1. You will be given a few default decks to get a feel of how the application works. 
2. You can create custom decks and cards within the decks. 
3. You can export decks as csv files to share information with friends/families, or create new decks by importing csv files
4. Once you are all set up, you can start learning. There are a few different modes available for you so you will never get bored of being tested by the same method throughout the process.
5. Lastly, sit back and be sturdy. Your knowledge will only ever going to get sturdier.



* There is a tutorial section below if you need further instructions on how to use the application.
* Feel free to read through the feature section to understand how our feature works.



#### Research and Problem statement 

From my learning experience and my observation with how humans learn, we humans learn and retain better through continuous repetition. As quoted from Tony Robbins,

> Repetitions is a mother of skill
> - Tony Robbins

**"Many students find it difficult to memorise information even though the information has been processed and understood. More often than not, subject contents delivered in a traditional method, do not provide students with the time and reinforcement tool to excel in mastering those content."**

With Sturdy Cards, you can be rest assured your learning will be taken care of. By using spaced repetition and several distinctive modes available to choose from, we can help you learn and retain information more effectively. For those who are already at an advanced level in a subject, your subject expertise can be further reinforced.

Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

### 

	Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user


# UML diagram
Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.


# trello
Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.


Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
